{"status": "rejected", "speakers": "glen ropella", "description": "Modeling and simulation (M&S) tools are often proprietary, which presents some significant reproducibility issues.  For standard operations research or mathematical models, where the industry is relatively mature, canonical model descriptions are plentiful and easy to access.  So, proprietary tools only inhibit the reproducibility (and heuristic value) to the extent that they cost money or require a particular platform (e.g. Windows).\r\n\r\nHowever, a somewhat novel form of M&S designed to study \"Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system emerged from the techniques developed by the \"computationalists\" (the grandfathers being Turing and von Neumann).  Fine-grained \"Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_modeling attempts to provide methods for instantiating hypothetical mechanisms (\"generators\") into a computer program, executing the program, and observing the resulting phenomena in order to provide descriptions of referent systems with significant heuristic value.  (This is in contrast to the analytic or mathematical models that emphasize predictive over heuristic value.)\r\n\r\nOne trouble with fine-grained ABMs are their complicatedness.  It is difficult or impossible to validate or falsify many of these models because they are full of nitty-gritty detail.  Even worse, it is often difficult or impossible to reproduce the results obtained from such a model because, by definition, CAS models are sensitive to the nitty-gritty detail.  Hence, the abstract, often prosaic, description provided by the modeler usually doesn't capture enough detail for the model to be reproduced by other researchers.\r\n\r\nAnd often, that detail can depend on the technology stack used to implement a model.  Hence, if any part of that stack is proprietary, it prevents full disclosure of the nitty-gritty computation used.\r\n\r\nUsing an open-source tech stack can be critical to the heuristic value of an ABM.\r\n\r\nThis session will present a few open-source modeling toolkits and present the basics of how to build an ABM in one or more of those toolkits.", "title": "Open Source Agent-Based Modeling Toolkits", "track": "Cooking", "excerpt": "Brief introduction and tutorial for building fine-grained agent-based models (ABMs) using open-source modeling toolkits like Swarm, RePast, MASON, etc.", "event": "2009", "id": 8, "audience_level": null}

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Keith Lofstrom", "description": "Large data centers are growing, and soon some will consume 50MW or more of electrical energy.  The EPA estimated US data center power consumption in 2006 at 60 billion kilowatt hours, or 1.5% of total US power consumption, and predicts a doubling by 2011.   Our efforts as programmers and technologists  will continue this exponential growth.  This will have huge environmental, social, and economic consequences unless we find alternative ways to power our digital economy.\r\n\r\nServer sky is a proposal to use the capabilities of Oregon companies such as Solar World, Intel, and Triquint to build large dispersed arrays of ultralight solar powered server satellites and launch them into 6000km earth orbit, between the inner and outer Van Allen belts.\r\n\r\nA 50 gram server-sat consists of a thinned 12 inch solar cell, with an efficient  2GIPs processor, terabit solid state disk, and microwave transmitter bonded to the back.  Thousands of server-sats position themselves into dozens of  dispersed three dimensional clouds  (kilometers on a side) using light pressure for thrust and liquid-crystal shutters for trimtab steering.   A server-sat array acts as a large phased array antenna, permitting it to steer thousands of communication beams at receiving stations and communities under its position in orbit, handing off communication and control to the server-sat clouds that follow it in orbit as it passes overhead.\r\n\r\nA Russian Dnepr rocket  could place a cylindrical stack of 50,000 server-sats into orbit for $15,000,000, or $300 per server-sat.  If each server-sat displaces 100 watts of ground-based electrical generation, cooling, and power conversion,  it will pay for itself in electrical savings alone in just a few years.  A server-sat will cost more to manufacture than a white-box PC, but it will not need the cases, racks,  cabling, power converters, land, buildings, power lines, and other materials needed to build a ground-based server farm.  Total resource usage is reduced, and the total manufacturing cost may become less than traditional approaches.  A server-sat array provides its own communication infrastructure and can reach the entire inhabited globe.  \r\n\r\nSince server-sat arrays operate outside the biosphere, the environmental impact of power generation and heat disposal is close to zero.  Server-sat arrays can grow to practically unlimited size - space is big, and filled with unused solar energy.  In time, new launch techniques, and solar cells made from lunar rock, can greatly reduce the environmental and economic costs of manufacturing and launch.  There is room for 1 trillion server-sats within a 100 millisecond ping time distance from earth. Someday, quintillions of server-sats scattered around the solar system  will perform cluster computation.  \r\n\r\nOf course, it will be built on open source technologies with best-of-breed security.

They want to take total control over your tests, how you write them, how you run them, even what you do with the results.  They don't play together, so you have to choose one and only one and hope it does everything you need.  They only work in one language, another language means learning another testing framework.  Having to do everything, they're big and complicated.\r\n\r\nTAP(Test Anything Protocol) is a simple text protocol to record test results.  A test program outputs its test results as TAP, and a parser interprets the results.  This simple separation of test from interpreter means the test code can be very small and very simple.  It means multiple programs, written in different languages, can make up a single test suite.  It means environments where testing is difficult, like Javascript or SQL functions, can be tested using native code.  It means you can write your own testing library, and then combine it with another.  There's no controlling framework!\r\n\r\nWe'll show off TAP, show you some TAP clients written in Perl, Javascript and even one written in Postgres.  We'll show how it can be used to archive test results and explore test suite history and growth.

Currently, I\u2019m collecting data for Debian, Slackware, Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, OpenSuse, Arch, Sabayon and Funtoo. I track each repository and the release date of each version of all packages.  The data will become available through oswatershed.org.  Hopefully, this data will increase the efficiency of distribution/repository maintenance.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation I will present three main ideas. First, I\u2019ll discuss some of the difficulties in collecting and normalizing the data. The largest issue is the potentially different names of a single package across the different distributions. For example, Gentoo has php but Ubuntu has php3, php4 and php5. In order, to compare the two these must be considered equal. This is not an easy task with 65,000 or so different package names.\r\n\r\nThe second and third things I will cover in my presentation are interesting trends and possible release cycle improvements. What this exactly entails is still uncertain. Much of the work on the data has yet to be done and by OSBridge three months more data will have accumulated.

We have  modest foundation funding for 2 years to launch this (starting April 2009).  http://visionon.tv\r\n\r\nAs a platform, visionOntv has a skinned and simplified version of Miro, currently with 5 main TV channels, enabling downloadable HD content. (All the other channels and options on Miro are easily available - our version merely adds an interface which helps users to transition from old to new media. All the options for wised-up users are still there.)\r\n\r\nThe \"main channels\" are a mixture of \"smart aggregation\" (syndicated rss feeds and separately posted content) and original programming which contextualises the other content for a wide audience. All content posted is also streamed, currently on 10 different sites via tubemogul.\r\n\r\nWe ran a solar-powered TV studio at the UK Camp for Climate Action in August 2008, producing some 25 shows (http://climatecamp.visionon.tv). We will have a beta of our CMS running by the time of the Open Video Conference.\r\n\r\nThe Presentation\r\n\r\nOur presentation asks precisely how open video could activate social change, and sets out some of the answers we are pursuing. Some of the questions are:\r\n\r\nCan alternative media really break out of the ghetto:\r\n  * Why do people watch mainstream TV news? \u2013 (info-tainment, slick packaging, personalities, etc).\r\n  * How can we compete with the mainstream in terms of entertainment and production values, so that our important ideas reach out beyond the small circles that they currently reach?\r\n  * What kind of filtering and molding of video content will enable it to become the new mainstream?\r\n  * How can compelling content be produced on a huge and global scale, for little or no budget and (therefore) with a short turnaround?\r\n  * Could citizen video journalism explode, with high-production-value, watchable films no longer being limited to a small group of the highly-trained?  \r\n  * Can it be done effectively by people whose main work is something else? \r\n\r\nWhat else does the new TV need to be?\r\nMuch of the technology for IPTV already exists, but the social outreach does not.  We have not yet built effective communities around video content, or, in many cases, around open source tools. Video blogging is individualistic, and we have not yet worked out how to deal with passivity, the thing which \u201cold media\u201d was actually designed around.\r\n\r\nIt is vital that we don't underestimate how difficult any of this is to achieve.  Here are 6 things that are needed for it:\r\n\r\n1. Production templates\r\n\r\nvisionOntv has prepared templates for effective films which can be made in an hour (http://tinyurl.com/d5p3tb), using automated animation of stills (http://tinyurl.com/c5bo2w). We are currently preparing a template for short video reportage, such as http://tinyurl.com/dc348e, which was picked up by rocketboom. There is a further template for the live-edit production of rapid-turnaround studio shows using webcams and software mixing (http://tinyurl.com/clozrm). The emphasis throughout is on how to do effective story-telling at very low budget for the widest possible viewership.\r\nWe will demonstrate all of these at the Open Video presentation.\r\n\r\n2. Training\r\n\r\nThe key to the mainstreaming of citizen journalism is training. visionOntv has funding to carry out a training programme in the UK, beginning June 2009, and plans to do it internationally.\r\n\r\n3. Smart aggregation\r\n\r\nThe careful selection of creative commons content based on quality. Putting the viewer first to build user trust and loyalty.\r\n\r\n4. Quality content needs quality upload\r\n\r\nWe have developed a transcoding standard which ensures that the video file is not too large, but can also be projected on a video beamer (important for communities with limited broadband access, and for promoting the collective experience which is a community screening). We will demonstrate this in the presentation.\r\n\r\n5. Open source production tools\r\n\r\nautomated animation for fast-turnaround citizens' reportage using stills\r\n  * video mixing for studio shows\r\n  * a really simple-to-use transcoding tool where all the options for the more technically-minded are available, but where the basic interface is \u201cstupidly simple\u201d.\r\n  * video editing (lite and full version)\r\n\r\nAt the moment, unfortunately, we have to use corporate solutions for all of the above.  We will never recommend to a novice citizen journalist a piece of software which is complex and forbidding.\r\nWe need open source tools which have the potential to take over completely from corporate tools.\r\n\r\nIn an adjoining proposal we have suggested working groups at the Open video Conference to develop these tools, which would match up software developers with professional users.\r\n\r\nBut something more than quality content is needed to enact social change.....\r\n\r\n6. Social media tools\r\n\r\nThe CMS\r\nvisionOntv is customising a completely modular open source cms, where any part of it can easily be imported to any other media project. This is vital. By using a java-based cms, any part can be taken and used as widget code. We are seeking to empower the users with a do-it-yourself cms. We are giving people a whole pile of tools which glue together, but can also be taken out separately into other sites and blogs, and where the keys to creating projects are not in the hands of the techies who created the original cms. This is a new kind of web application where users can create their own resources around our content, and all the tools will talk to each other. Users can build their own gateways into our material for their particular needs, and we could then gain from their new creative commons content. Put simply, it allows the user to manage the content.\r\n\r\nvisionOntv's cms will have superior chat functions on video streaming, by being layered in such a way that you will be able to chat to anyone else who is watching the film, or to anyone who is watching the channel, or to anyone who is watching anything on the station as a whole.  Viewers can then break out into campaigning (or more purely social, even dating) forums, so that an activist minority starts to feel like a large community, sharing ideas and ideals, planning actions together, discussing the effectiveness of different tactics, and in all kinds of unpredictable ways making social change. \r\n(We will have a beta of the cms by the time of the Open Video conference)\r\n\r\nThe playlist generator\r\nThis will be created in three phases: the first allows us to create a coherent look and feel using an \"old TV\" metaphor \u2013 permitting us to create seasons which publish at the same time each week, to insert \"in-betweens\", and to differentiate daytime programming from \"primetime\".\r\nIn future versions, content will be user-controlled, for instance by \"I like it / I don't like it\" ratings.\r\n\r\nMetadata\r\nMetadata standards need to derive from actual practice, in a decentralized way, rather than being centrally-defined in the abstract. visionOntv is doing this, rolling out embeds in content-specific websites using tags.\r\n\r\nProposal 2: Workshop\r\n\r\nWouldn't we all like to make a living from what we do:\r\nFunding / monetizing open video production \u2013 a round-robin \u2013 an opportunity for everyone to share their experiences, good and bad, of funding or monetizing the production and distribution of radical or open video. We can contribute our own experience from a UK/European perspective. And we have a concrete plan for sustainability of the VOTV project which we would like technical support for.\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal 3: \r\nWorking groups on the different pieces of software to define a spec for development:\r\n  * video editing \u2013 both lite for citizen journalists (replacing i-moive and movie maker) and full for professionals (replacing FCP, Avid and Adobe Premiere)\r\n  * video mixing for studio shows\r\n  * transcoding tool \u2013 really intuitive to use on first sight\r\n  * automated animation \u2013 for fast-turnaround citizen journalist reportage with stills\r\n\r\nProposal 4: \r\nWe would also like a suitbale corner (preferably in a cafe) to install a \u201cmin-sin\u201d, a computer in kiosk mode playing a custom version of Miro.

{"status": "proposed", "speakers": "BJ Clark", "description": "Rails has powered Oakley.com, a site generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the past two years. It has 80 models, an equal number of controllers, 75k lines of code\u2026and no tests. I will talk about how we\u2019ve been chipping away at growing an effective, valuable test suite since I\u2019ve come on with Oakley.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Rails has powered AboutUs.org for over a year and now handles every request to the site (around 10 million unique visits a month). It has 60 controllers, 250 models, and a test suite that takes 6-8 minutes to run every time. On top of this, the Rails app still uses MediaWiki as a webservice, so it depends on an unknown number of lines of PHP which is not covered by any tests in the PHP code base. We will talk about how we are switching to Rspec and Cucumber, brought online a CI process, and how we manage code that may not be \u201cThe Rails Way\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere the hell do I start?\u201d That\u2019s the question people ask when they first toy with the idea of adding tests to an existing application. We certainly can\u2019t stop development and spend weeks just writing tests. How do we maximize the value we get from time spent adding tests? Writing high-level acceptance tests that step through complete usage scenarios, are perfect for casting a big net and getting a lot of regression coverage.\r\n\r\nWe write tests to cover existing code so that we can add new features and fix bugs. When working on a piece of untested code, we must spend time analyzing the possible consequences of our changes. From there, we can write an acceptance test to cover the broad area, and then write unit tests for various objects and methods that we touch. Then we can test-drive the new feature or bug fix.\r\n\r\nMaddox\u2019s Law: 99% of untested code is untestable code. I\u2019ll talk about mindful refactorings that you can perform without the safety net of tests, in order to get the code to a point where you can test it.\r\n\r\nTo keep the scope of our testing and changes small, we need to be able to isolate dependencies in code. There are many techniques for identifying and introduces seams into your code, which allows you to isolate or break dependencies. I will also discuss how Ruby\u2019s dynamic nature enables powerful techniques that aren\u2019t available to programmers in other languages.\r\n\r\nContinuous integration is extremely valuable when you\u2019re building a test suite. It allows you to run the slower acceptance tests asynchrously rather than slowing down your development workflow. Setting up CI might be a challenge in its own right, given that testability was not built into the system. At Oakley, simply checking out the source code and setting up an app is an ordeal, with lots of migration scripts in different locations, external dependencies, and hidden knowledge such as storing default values in the db at a certain ID. I\u2019ll talk about some of the challenges we\u2019ve faced and how we\u2019ve been able to make gradual improvements.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the technical challenges, politics are another common roadblock to introducing automated testing. How do you sell your boss on taking some extra time to test? How can you get the other developers in your organization on board with a testing strategy? How do you responsibly begin testing when you don\u2019t have much experience with it?\r\n\r\nMost people have a superficial understanding of how valuable testing can be, but many people are facing too much pressure at work to feel confident in getting started. There\u2019s a lot of discussion about TDD and how great it is, but in the real world we frequently have to deal with lots of code that has not been tested at all. How can we take a mass of untested code that runs our businesses, and start working to the ideal of high-quality, malleable, tested code, while still meeting the demands of high productivity in our daily work?

{"status": "proposed", "speakers": "Benjamin L. Berry", "description": "AirShip Technologies Group\u2019s open technology innovation (OTI) manufacturing approach is a collaborative process modeled on a method that for more than a decade has been closely associated with community open source software development.  It's called Open Technology Innovation because the collaboration is open to all and the innovative source technology is shared, branded and licensed with participating stakeholders.  Open technology harnesses the distributive powers of the Internet, parcels the work out to thousands, and uses their piecework to build a better whole - putting informal networks of volunteer corporations, governments and individuals in collaborative teams.  It works like an ant colony, where the collective intelligence of the network supersedes any single contributor.  Open technology is doing for mass innovation what the assembly line did for mass production.  Get ready for the era when collaboration replaces command and control.\r\n\r\nOpen Technology Innovation (OTI) manufacturing functions as a strategic resource marshalling organizations and individuals worldwide to produce cutting edge transformational products.  The focus is on business, science, engineering and human capital to create high return technology innovation.  The goal is to establish open technology manufacturing and innovation as the next level in collaborative product and service creation. \r\n\r\nTechnology\u2019s transformative power has always been a source of great expectations and challenges.  Today, globalization, fuelled by information, communication and transportation technologies is rapidly changing every society.  The drive towards globalization creates a new set of unique demands on government, business, and people\u2019s everyday lives.  Increasingly, decision makers in various fields are looking to technology to provide solutions and drive desired changes by commingling local, national and global resources in innovative ways.\r\n\r\nOpen Technology Innovation seeks the fusion of technology and globalization producing a new way to adapt, innovate and grow in this changing world.  A potent combination of connectivity, collaboration, access and transparency \u2013 or openness \u2013 is emerging.  Governments and enterprises around the world are embracing it.  This openness is helping governments, companies and individuals respond to the increasing requirements of an on-demand, high-speed world.  In the forefront is environmental sustainability where AirShip Technologies Group will design viable, clean and super-efficient vehicles that people and businesses want to buy.  OTI uses the openness factor seen mostly in the Open Source Software Model to unleash newfound comparative advantage, invention, social development and market opportunities in all sorts of technologies.  The AirShip Use Case Open Technology Innovation Map uses the OTI process to collaborate resources on the development, construction and rollout of the AirShipTG ground vehicles for cars and long haul trucks.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to enable worldwide stakeholders from industry and society to contribute to how the AirShipTG innovative product is introduced, developed and produced.  To do this, we use a global perspective from those with knowledge and hands-on experience in order to develop this new ground transportation vehicle architecture to establish this new and competitive technology.  Using an OTI-based web site portal, every region of the world is invited to participate and share insights from organizations at the forefront of technology to inquiring individuals who wish to contribute.\r\n\r\nOTI members provide practical insights that help everyone move toward open technology beneficial to all its stakeholders and the world at large.  While networking the team worldwide, OTI will grow a large repository of AirShipTG Open Technology development and applications collaboratively developed over the Internet, but will host the AirShipTG manufacturing and construction site in Oregon.  As a result via this web portal, AirShip Technologies Group plans to host the development team and recruit investment contributors to the project.  By hosting for Open Technology development projects, the spirit of the Open Collaborative Development Lifecycle is modeled on rapid creation of solutions within this open, collaborative environment.  Collaboration within the Open Technology community promotes a higher standard of quality, and helps to ensure the long-term viability of the AirShipTG.\r\n\r\nOTI Work Groups \u2013 How Things Get Done!\r\n\r\nAdapted from the Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) Business Model\r\n\r\nOTI works in partnership with organizations, institutions, and individuals willing to place their separate agenda second to the cause of collaborating to raise their global competitive advantage via the AirShipTG ground transit vehicles.  We determined there is an appetite for a new organizational business model that leverages existing and emerging efforts in a more coherent and cohesive global action plan.  We determined how to foster greater collaboration or most importantly the global social networks required to engage people and institutions along a pathway leading to real-time action-taking and measurable performance.  As we found in our interviews and forums, most organizations are interested in finding a more effective mechanism for improving linkages \u2013 linking traditional and new economy clusters, linking existing and emerging civic and business leaders, linking institutional strengths and competencies.  While many forums exist for creating these linkages, the lack of measurement related to the outcomes of these forums has left organizations frustrated over the results.  Yet no one individual or organization has expressed frustration about the continued need to identify the most efficient and effective means of \u201cgetting the job done\u201d to advance the technology agenda.\r\n\r\nThus, the most important next step for technology organizations, entrepreneurial, academic research, and organizational collaborative interests is to create a setting for taking action around a handful of objectives and tactics that can be measured in real-time for expected and vital results.  The question for the automotive technology industry is plain: how do we look at our current innovation systems and improve our competitiveness by strengthening these linkages and the performance of many stakeholders in a technology-based global economy?\r\n\r\nDeciding on the AirShip Use Case:\r\n\r\nDetermining which projects work for open technology use cases is about filtering or sorting out what to keep, what to discard, what to adopt, and where to intensify our focus.  AirShip Technologies Group has decided to develop the ground transit vehicles based on the OTI model because of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\u00b7   Transformational \u2013 Is the use case transformational?  With the advent of technology and globalization, projects that transform can represent deep change.  Deep change differs from incremental change in that it requires new ways of thinking and behaving.  It is change that is major in scope, discontinuous with the past and generally irreversible for society (once adopted).  This deep transformational change filter means surrendering control and on any level entails some inherent risk.  To adapt to the profound changes of our times, transformational projects are willing to go out on a limb, to take some big risks by stepping outside of well-established boundaries and current thinking!\r\n\r\n\u00b7   Virtualization \u2013 Can the use case project be developed in a virtual environment?  The business paradigm of the 20th century was one of centralized organizations using a management hierarchy of command and control.  The majority of employees were located in a single facility, and management acted as command central.  The old model suffers from numerous age-related problems, not just an outdated notion of work management.  From a human capital standpoint, it is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve proximity of desired brains.  The best people might not be willing or able to devote four hours each day to getting to and from work.  The best people might not even be within commuting distance of the office, city, state or country.  As specialization continues to drive areas of expertise, it is likely that a particular skill set might be vested in one individual or a small group of individuals\u2014in Bangalore, India, perhaps.  When such expertise is located outside an urban setting, the individual or individuals might not want to move away from their perceived paradise.  The people possessing the critical skill set might not even want to work a 9-to-5 workday.  However, tapping into that expertise might be the difference between OTI\u2019s survival and failure with hypercompetitive products or services.  As such, OTI projects must be adoptable to business process virtualization, where the application of intelligent network-enabled open collaboration leverages people and their intellectual productivity, capital, and infrastructure to achieve quantum improvements in productivity, profitability, and competitiveness.  It is not just about technology, but derives from the application of a new approach to management, a new focus by technologists, a new focus in process oversight, and enlightened involvement by many of the traditionally passive (or disruptive) business support activities.\r\n\r\n\u00b7   Global Market \u2013 Does the use case create a new set of competencies for global market advantage?  This filter assumes that the primary motivations driving the success of the product has global comparative and competitive advantages that are gained by the integration of various value-added characteristics or outcomes that necessitate development of a new set of competencies for a global market advantage.  Presumably, this advantage is associated with positive strategic and financial returns.\r\n\r\n\u00b7   Trends for Open Use Patents  \u2013 Is the use case open use patentable?   OTI products and services are selected for their prospects of open use instead of proprietary patents.  The role of patents in the expanding world of open technology is evolving.  Scientific and technological advances have created new waves of innovation, and innovation processes themselves have become centered less on individual firms and more dependent on interactions among global networks of companies, governments and individuals.  Trend shifts in the legal and regulatory framework of patent regimes have resulted in more expansive domains of patentable subject matter and more robust and more valuable patents.  OTI\u2019s open use license agreements lead to increased commercialization of inventions generating greater benefits worldwide.  OTI use cases are designed to ensure access to basic inventions and licensing practices free of charge.  By agreeing to the open use license, organizations are free to use and brand the product or service.\r\n\r\n\u00b7   Innovation \u2013 Does the use case innovate?  OTI projects recognize that successful technologies must be prime stimuli for business innovation and an enabler of competitive advantage or best-in-class service delivery\u2014and in themselves have the potential as key participants in a process that develops business and introduces something new for the first time!\r\n\r\n\u00b7   Cross Use Ability \u2013 Can the use case be used for multiple purposes?  The ability of use cases to retain technological advances will, in many cases, depend on the project\u2019s ability to take advantage of dual or cross use opportunities.  Cross use promotes an advantage of the competitive pressures and market-driven efficiencies.  This competitive, market-driven approach increases the pace at which technological improvements are incorporated and adopted, while at the same time reducing the incremental costs of those products or services.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe AirShip ground transit vehicles meet the use case requirements of the OTI Model.  Moreover, the vehicles are considered a SMART vehicles because its software development incorporates drive-by-wire magleve spherical induction motor based Track Sphere maneuverability, collision avoidance, communications, and advanced warning and failure control.  Computer hardware is miniaturized to the greatest extent feasible and technology reduces power consumption.  Software development includes system modules for energy computer control, computer geographical navigation map display, vehicle digital remote entry controls, electric photovoltaic science, and on-board computer interactive voice controls/announcement.\r\n\r\nAirShip Technologies Group has formed this Open Technology Community of Practice to develop the AirShip\u2019s computer programs, making it the first Open Technology inspired vehicle development.  These software programs will provide real-time operation of the above described computer systems.  The majority of application systems will be designed around off-the-shelf computers and the open source Linux operating system.  The firm will take advantage of reusable open source software to provide most of the functions needed.  To tie these open source software modules together, software developers will write lines of code to facilitate the integration process.  This programming will unlock the capability of open source software modules that in many cases will contain hundreds of lines of code.\r\n\r\nReal-time, redundant, on-board computers augment AirShip operational safety.  The AirShipTG's SMART software modules, advanced warning and correction systems advances the operator's ability to operate the vehicle beyond the capabilities of a traditional cars and trucks.

{"status": "proposed", "speakers": "Grant Kruger", "description": "Once programmers twisted wires to create programs. Software languages arrived and they adjusted and grew as the languages grew. They adjusted to databases, networks, Macs, PCs, the Interwebs, etc. Ideally the adjustments are incremental and manageable, enough to challenge, even to stretch, but not so much that it overwhelms.\r\n\r\nNow, how big is the challenge of swapping from closed to open anyway? One might move from giant mainframes and massive multi-million dollar projects, or from the land of expensive desktop/network packages and licenses. If you're lucky you might move to a related situation, for example from .NET to Rails. One likely moves to FOSS from software too expensive to own copy, making it hard/impossible to have their own projects on the side and stifling sharing and collaboration beyond the confines of a given project. They may have worked on massive, well-managed international teams, but nothing as organic as the open source world.\r\n\r\nMost were used to longer projects built to last decades, with large/huge teams, vast budgets, excessive planning, complex methodologies, reams of documentation, teams of QA testers and managers who could handle the kinds of clients with millions to spend.

It's quite possible that every piece of software they use will change, from operating system, through framework. The learning curve can be overwhelming. What are the warnings and pitfalls?

{"status": "proposed", "speakers": "j. brush, Dietrich Ayala, Cameron Adamez", "description": "h4. Economy in crisis\r\n\r\nOld-school economies are collapsing, rooted in a breakdown of trust and information flow (ie. credit). At the same time our societies need to radically restructure themselves to address peak oil and climate change, but existing dominant economic actors -- corporate or state -- seem \r\nrudderless. \r\n\r\nThe alternative is for a different kind of economy to emerge, in which grassroots movements and local (virtual) communities have the ability to dynamically plan and organize economic actions based on their own values. This is already happening, and we can support such emergence \r\nusing tools adapted from and developed through the open source community. \r\n\r\nh4. Economy as information technology\r\n\r\nAn economy is a way of coordinating needs and resources. Central planning does this by funneling information through hierarchical structures. Markets do this by translating wildly diverse kinds of \r\nrelevant information into one universal metric: price. (This is oversimplified, and actually existing economies combine these and other methods at all levels.) \r\n \r\nThe \"real\" economy has developed vast and top-heavy infrastructures of regulation, ratings, risk-management, financing, and the like in order to manage the information flow of its systems. That is, at least in principle, to get real needs met efficiently with available resources. \r\nAnd it's not working. \r\n \r\nBut information technology, and open source development in particular, has developed a wide range of functional approaches to such problems that can be ported over to the \"real\" economy. *Econix* is a tag for applying the lessons and tools of the hacker culture (ie. Unix) to the \r\nbroader economy. \r\n\r\nh4. Economy as semantic web\r\n\r\nThe web is already a vast economy -- some of it monetized, much of it not. People make offers and requests for goods and services; people publicly or privately rate the reliability, coolness, eco-friendliness, etc. of economic partners; people schedule meetings, coordinate \r\nprojects, get things done. \r\n\r\nBut it's (becoming) exhausting as hell to (most of) those who use it that way, and overwhelming to those who don't. There's too much information to sift through, too many platforms to engage, too much to keep track of. \r\n \r\nAs this information becomes formatted so that techology can read it -- and microformats are already starting to help this happen -- then we can develop tools that sort and prioritize this sea of information for us. \r\n\r\nh4. Economy as distributed user-driven values engine\r\n\r\nThen, each user can define how they want their economy to function. Who do they trust? What do they value? What do they need? What do they have to offer? How do they want to make choices about what to work on when? \r\n \r\nTools can use preferences tuned as finely as desired to cascade trust networks and tagged ratings in complex ways, presenting the user with a fully customized, simple, prioritized list of likely-useful economic opportunities. \r\n\r\nh4. Introducing Swiftr: an Econix aggregator\r\n\r\nWe'll introduce our initial proof-of-concept economic aggregator project, as an example. This is intended to work with existing data pools (using microformats and/or scraping), as well as new-model data exchange mechanisms like The Mine! project. \r\n \r\nWe'll also discuss our three-pronged approach, combining deep engagement with grassroots organizing in Portland as initial user-base with evangelizing in the tech / data platform community, and open source development of a working tool. \r\n \r\nAnd we'll facilitate conversation on: \r\n \r\n* other existing projects that connect with the idea of Econix \r\n* other ways the economy can be galvanized using open source techniques \r\n* implementation challenges and workarounds \r\n", "title": "Econix: tools for free and open (source) grassroots economies", "track": "Culture", "excerpt": "In a context of economic crisis, new economies are emerging in which groups and individuals dynamically plan and organize economic actions based on their own values.

Since it's a source-based distribution, it comes by default with the full toolchain and related tools (autotools, flex, bison, etc). Furthermore, the packages are not split up, so if you have a package installed, you have all of that package: no searching around for -devel, -headers, -debuginfo, or whatever else.\r\n\r\nTo set up a decent development system, you often want to install debugging versions of a lot of libraries and maybe even install the source code too. Gentoo provides for that with features that install separate debuginfo files that are automatically found by gdb and that will also install the source code.\r\n\r\nOn a lower level, you might want to make sure your code compiles on a wide variety of compilers before shipping or releasing it. Gentoo's gcc-config lets you dynamically switch between multiple installed compilers, and you can even use non-GCC compilers for Gentoo packages by simply setting CC in /etc/make.conf or the environment.\r\n\r\nGentoo supports cross-compiling quite nicely with a tool called crossdev that integrates with Portage to make building cross-compiling toolchains completely trivial. All you have to do is pass crossdev the target and it takes care of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe last, most advanced and possibly most useful aspect of Gentoo for development is the ease of packaging your code. Writing ebuilds is just writing bash shell scripts. If you can build it by hand, you can make an ebuild for it.

It's usually not enough to be a good developer. You need to know about the business side of software development, including sales and marketing and legal and accounting. Fret not - just like programming, these are skills that can be learned!\r\n\r\nHow do you find work and how do you determine how much to charge?

What are the unique selling points that can help catapult your company to the shortlist? Positioning your services and finding a niche are essential to differentiate yourself from other competing vendors.\r\n\r\nHow do you structure contracts to allow for the software you create to be GPL licensed? The legal issues cannot be overlooked if you want to ensure your software remains open source. Education of your customers is important to get them to think of software not as an asset, but a liability.\r\n\r\nHow do you recruit and retain talented developers? The transparency of open source software provides you with developer footprints that reveal far more about a developer's technical skills than any resume. I have recruited some of my best developers solely by reading their code and their blog posts to get a sense for how they communicate.\r\n\r\nOpen source software is often developed by distributed teams, in which the leaders and developers are geographically dispersed. Can this team dynamic work for consulting projects? We've learned through many failed attempts what works and what doesn't, navigating timezones, multi-currency payments, remote pair programming, and global conference calls.\r\n\r\nHow can you be a profitable company and still be a good citizen of the open source community?

A crisis may be a large event such as a tsunami, an earthquake, a terrorist attack or other large scale disaster. A crisis may be something smaller such as a house fire, or a pileup on the freeway, a gas leak or a road out. A crisis may be something relatively minor, a crisis only to one person, such as being locked out of ones car, or trying to find a lost pet, or needing help sharing babysitting duties.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this talk I am interested in the far end of the long tail of crisis response - and what open source technology we can strap together to build tactical systems for helping tackle such crisis. I have been developing an approach using off the shelf tools that can help resolve local crisis - the smaller more personal crisis that interrupts peoples lives.\r\n\r\nIf we watch messages over a city, and provide analytic views for interested parties, then a role for \"angels\" to participate emerges. Interested individuals can act in a matchmaking capacity to connect complementary interests together. We can collaboratively up-score or down-score public comments aggregated from a variety of geo local sources. We can filter away noise so that responders can more easily decide what to respond to. In sum we can make it possible for people on the ground, in the area, to volunteer to help out by providing clarity.\r\n\r\nI consider these class of services to be a kind of ubiquitous angel. They are not something that you have to even know exist until they help you.\r\n\r\nThe tools that we can leverage today to build such services are worth knowing - having many applications. In particular solr ( an enterprise search engine ) and carrot2 ( a topic clustering engine ) can play a powerful role in helping filter noise. Other related projects in particular Ushahidi and Swift have a high degree of overlap and those technologies will be discussed as well.\r\n\r\nBeyond today there's a role for such technology to help us deal with new kinds of crisis in the future.

Over the past three years it has grown from a promising one-developer project to a 1.0 release as an officially supported ORM for the popular \"symfony framework\":http://www.symfony-project.org/.\r\n\r\nI've been using Doctrine on symfony-based web projects for two years now.  In this session, I'll give a high level tour of the library, focusing on the features that will save you time in your day-to-day development.  The session will assume some familiarity with object-oriented programming in PHP5, but will be light on code.\r\n\r\nSome of the features you can expect to learn about include:\r\n\r\n* Use the Doctrine Query Language (DQL) to write queries using the language of your model rather than your relational database.  Get back hydrated objects.\r\n\r\n* Start from a yaml-based schema file and automatically create your database.  Or, start from an existing database and automatically create your schema file.  Either way, your model classes are generated for you.\r\n\r\n* Hydrate objects with all their related objects pre-loaded... or, lazy-load the relationships only when they are requested.\r\n\r\n* Use a sophisticated selection of hooks and event listeners to inject custom functionality into your model at various levels: system-wide, for one connection, or per model class.\r\n\r\n* 'Behaviors' add common types of functionality to a record class.  Choose from a variety of useful included behaviors such as 'Timestampable' or 'Searchable', or implement your own functionality shared by several classes in your model.\r\n", "title": "Doctrine: object-relational mapping for PHP", "track": "Cooking", "excerpt": "Doctrine is a powerful object-relational mapper for PHP.

However, Xlib has not been well-matched to the needs of X clients for some time now. We felt it had earned retirement, so we created a new X-protocol C Binding (XCB) library, providing a simple, small, thread-transparent interface to X. But to support all the applications that haven't magically ported themselves to XCB yet, we needed a transition plan.\r\n\r\nWe first tried re-writing Xlib from scratch as a layer on top of XCB. That was hard. So we stopped.\r\n\r\nThen we added some hooks to XCB to allow Xlib to remain mostly unchanged but send requests through XCB. That worked, mostly; however, the complexity of this approach led to bugs, ugly hacks in XCB, and far more hacking on Xlib than continued sanity permitted. Adding special code in our clean new XCB library just to keep the old Xlib way working made us sad, and the looming prospect of becoming the Xlib maintainers made us lose sleep. So we stopped that too.\r\n\r\nThe current versions of Xlib and XCB now use a technique that we call \"socket handoff\", cooperatively alternating exclusive access to the X connection instead of dumping Xlib's requests through XCB. Socket handoff allowed us to delete a pile of buggy, hackish code, while improving performance, and that made us happy. So we didn't stop.\r\n\r\nThe socket handoff interface has proven to be useful not just for Xlib, but also for new language bindings to XCB and for experimental X protocol-level hacks. We believe other network protocol implementations would also benefit from this approach.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you may be running our socket handoff code on your system right now, so why not come hear about the code used by every application on your desktop?", "title": "Socket handoff: Concurrent fd sharing for performance and innovation", "track": "Cooking", "excerpt": "When different components want to use a shared resource in different ways--such as when they're implemented in different programming languages, or have APIs that aren't trivially compatible--the result is an API design challenge.

The \"stuff\" may be physical objects&mdash;anything from quilts to machine guns to postage stamps&mdash;or it may be abstract concepts such as genres of music.  It may be painstakingly organized and catalogued or a jumbled mess.  It may be in spreadsheets, word processor documents, ancient in-house database systems, or expensive third-party museum collection management systems... or only a twinkle in a curator's eye.\r\n\r\nSecond Story builds custom interactive installations for museums and other cultural institutions.  Before we can focus on presenting the content, we have to figure out how to normalize existing content, create and maintain new content, and deliver the content for consumption by whatever presentation technology we plan to use.  Fortunately for us, many tools that are designed to solve these problems on the Web are also very suitable for delivering content to kiosks, interactive tables, or more exotic interactive installations.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen to use the \"symfony framework\":http://www.symfony-project.org/.  Symfony is a full-stack web framework for PHP.  One of its features is a powerful system for creating administrative interfaces based on your database model.  This system is easy enough to create useful admin tools almost immediately using only yaml-based config files, while remaining flexible enough to allow for significant customization when necessary.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I provide a high-level overview of symfony and the symfony admin generator in the context of museum installations.  Throughout the session I'll use real-world examples of kiosks and interactive tables we've created for museums such as the Walt Disney Family Museum, the GRAMMY Museum, and the Gettysburg National Park Museum and Visitor Center.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Haiping Zhao", "description": "The main challenge of the project was bridging the gap between PHP and C++. PHP is a scripting language with dynamic, weak typing. C++ is a compiled language with static typing. While PHP allows you to write magical dynamic features, most PHP is relatively straightforward. It's more likely that you see if (...) {...} else {..} than it is to see function foo($x) { include $x; }. This is where we gain in performance. Whenever possible our generated code uses static binding for functions and variables. We also use type inference to pick the most specific type possible for our variables and thus save memory.\r\n\r\nThe transformation process includes three main steps:\r\n\r\n1. Static analysis where we collect information on who declares what and dependencies,\r\n2. Type inference where we choose the most specific type between C++ scalars, String, Array, classes, Object, and Variant, and\r\n3. Code generation, which for the most part is a direct correspondence from PHP statements and expressions to C++ statements and expressions.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed HPHPi, which is an experimental interpreter designed for development. When using HPHPi you don't need to compile your PHP source code before running it. It's helped us catch bugs in HipHop itself and provides engineers a way to use HipHop without changing how they write PHP.\r\n\r\nOverall HipHop allows us to keep the best aspects of PHP while taking advantage of the performance benefits of C++.

The next step was to build software to interface with the wireless sensors and capture the data that they were sending. The interface software (called XBeeLib) uses Apache Mina as a major component to handle translation of packets to and from the wireless modules. The monitoring software (called pHomeNet) is a Java-based system running on the Apache Felix OSGi container. Observations from the sensors are recorded into a database (Apache Derby by default). Although the system is currently focused on recording temperature sensor data, it could easily be adapted to record data from other sensors or even to control devices based on sensor inputs.

With over 200 people who have committed code to the project, there are hundreds of thousands of Tiki installations worldwide, including the Firefox Support site that is directly linked from in-browser help.\r\n\r\nWith so many possibilities for different uses, the Tiki Community was looking for a way to rapidly deploy applications on the platform, avoiding tedious and repeated \"reinventing the wheel\" configuration of the many individual features. These deployment configurations are defined in YAML, a popular machine-parsable data serialization format that is designed for human readability. Called Tiki Profiles, these configurations are extremely modular, and can be combined to form larger applications. For example, it is possible to combine the configurations for a Time Sheet, a Task List and a Consultant List, to create a basic consultant time-management system. When executed, the Tiki Profiles engine will automatically configure necessary features, create content pages, data structures, user groups, permissions, and input forms that make up the application.\r\n\r\nThese modular configurations in easy-to-learn YAML are shared just like open source code, but within a wiki, profiles.tikiwiki.org. Not just developers, but power users and business analysts can enhance or combine these configurations, leading to new and innovative applications for the platform. For example, the basic consultant time-management system as mentioned above can easily be augmented with a Budget Tracking application to enhance billing management. Repeated application configuration becomes easy, and application variants can be managed more effectively as incremental add-ons to the same base Tiki Profile.\r\n\r\nThe same approach of open-source sharing of configurations should be applicable to most platforms that involve significant numbers of configuration options and choices leading to differing applications.

When you realize that virtual servers are disposable, and that you can launch a new one in a matter of minutes programatically, you architect your application differently, to take advantage of the transient nature of the servers. But this transiency is also an advantage because you decouple the parts so they are no longer co-mingled, thus making your site more resilient to failure.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss the wonderful world of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and in particular Amazon EC2. We will explain how you can use Elastic Block Storage to make a virtual disk that can hold up to 1TB of data, how you can auto-scale your application using Amazon's monitoring services, and how you can create Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to distribute your software in the form of a bootable virtual machine and more.\r\n\r\nWe will look at several real-life examples of open source software applications that have been deployed to Amazon EC2, and what particular tools and strategies we leveraged to streamline the deployment and hosting of these applications.

The website design template can be any arbitrary HTML/CSS - there's nothing Plone specific about it.\r\n\r\nDeliverance takes the HTML that your CMS or web application generates and maps it into placeholders into your website design, and you use a simple rules file to tell Deliverance which elements to map over and where they should go.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this approach is that the design and the code can be developed independently of one another, providing a true separation of presentation and content.

{"status": "rejected", "speakers": "Jayadev Chandrasekhar", "description": "Server optimization for high traffic web systems using multiple retry and learning timeout patterns.\r\n\r\nMultiple Retry is a feature meant to optimize system resource utilization while still allowing a webpage to accommodate requests that might take a long time for the responses to come back. It uses two open source technologies Squid and Traffic Server (recently open sourced by Yahoo! under apache license).\r\n\r\nThe main principle behind it is to delegate the request to an offline proxy system such as SQUID to perform the actual request. This allows the initial request to use a very small timeout but yet the proxy system will continue to wait for the request to complete and then cache the response once it comes back. A subsequent request or 'retry request' is made to check the data in the proxy system cache instead of the actual source. The timed out request sends the squid key back to the client to track the availability of the resource quickly without going through the normal web server route. \r\n\r\nThe traffic server which can handle thousands of concurrent connections has a plugin which can quickly check the status of the key from squid directly and if the data is indeed available, can forward the request to corresponding web servers.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, server resource does not need to be tied up for the entire duration for the response to come back. Instead, just use limited resource to fire the request and then tell the client(browser) to wait a period of time before firing another request(retry request) to check for response. As a result, transferring a significant amount of wait time from server resources to the client side and freeing up that server resource to process other requests. Each retry request will be optimized to firstly just check whether the data is available in cache using the traffic server plugin before executing the webpage or module which requires that data. This saves the need to process a webpage or a module only to find that the data is not yet available in cache and process the page only once the data is indeed available thus saving cpu cycles. Since the request reaches web server only when data is available and hence it is an efficient utilization of server processes.\r\n\r\nAlso an additional challenge the system need to address is determining what timeouts to use for each retry. This could be tracked by a very simple state at server and slowly adjusted and learned with requests to determine the optimal time interval to be given for retries and reducing failed attempts.\r\n\r\nThus for very high traffic systems like yahoo homepage , where we have data coming from different external sources with varying timeouts we can defer the request for multiple retry and load the page as soon as possible. Each retry request would be extremely fast to just check for the data availability in cache thus freeing server time and other processing resources. This solution does not require keep-alive connections to be maintained and hence has very little server setup overhead.", "title": "Server optimization for high traffic web systems using multiple retry and learning timeout patterns", "track": "Chemistry", "excerpt": "A webpage typically will be as slow as the slowest request in the page.

{"status": "proposed", "speakers": "Peter Eckersley", "description": "Despite a decade of the war on file sharing, copyright piracy continues to be a widespread social phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDebates about the ethical status of piracy are often bipolar: copyright holders attempt to equate piracy with \"theft\", while hacker and pirate groups argue that copyright is unsustainable and view piracy as good, inevitable, or promoting of renewal in cultural industries. Informally, some file sharers defend a position along the lines of \"I pirate music, but then I buy CDs from the bands I like\" or \"I pirate major label music but buy independent artists' CDs\".\r\n\r\nThis talk examines the coherence of these positions. Is piracy ever \"theft\" in an ethical sense? If it's not theft, is it selfish? Is pirating major label music an ethically defensible form of civil disobedience? If it was ethical to engage in piracy as a form of protest, would that create an obligation to engage in piracy?\r\n\r\nThe conclusions are complex. The ethical status of piracy turns out to depend on difficult social choices about justice and aesthetic priorities, on what is being copied, and on who is copying it. On some theories, even if there are limited circumstances in which piracy is justified as a form of civil disobedience, many file sharers go too far with their actions. On the other hand, there may be circumstances in which there are weak ethical obligations to pirate things, and non-pirates could be said to be ignoring those obligations.", "title": "The Complex Ethics of Piracy", "track": "Culture", "excerpt": "The Complex Ethics of Piracy\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to replace the \"piracy is good\" vs \"piracy is theft\" debate with a more nuanced understanding. It will investigate when piracy is selfish; when it is civil disobedience; whether it is ever constructive for cultural industries, or whether it is ever, as copyright holders argue, \"theft\".\r\n\r\nI will conclude that each of these things is sometimes true about piracy, and that simple views are inadequate for understanding the ethical dimension of copyright infringement. Both pirates and copyright industries need to develop more subtle understandings of the morality of file sharing.\r\n", "event": "2010", "id": 475, "audience_level": null}

I then built a set of 6 robots and taught an after-school class to 4-8 grade students at Faubion in NE Portland.\r\n\r\nThe software wasn't quite ready for prime time when I started teaching the class, so I was very fortunate that Jim Larson, a software/hardware engineer here in Portland joined in and together we collaborated with others in Brazil to further develop the software to better meet the needs of the students.\r\n\r\nWhat we have is:\r\n- A robot that costs about $40-50 to make\r\n- All open-source software\r\n- Mostly open-source hardware\r\n- Can be used with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux\r\n- Uses Logo based commands\r\n- Simple, easy to assemble command blocks eliminates syntax frustrations\r\n- The software also accepts Cricket Logo, a text based language \r\n- And most importantly: It's just plain FUN to use!\r\n\r\nJim Larson, myself, and others in Brazil continue to gather and develop resources to help others that want to try it themselves or, hopefully, teach classes to kids and introduce them to programming/electronics/robotics.\r\n\r\nI am starting to put together resources at the following website:\r\nhttp://home.teleport.com/~brettn/babuinobot/\r\n", "title": "Making Robots Accessible to Everyone", "track": "Culture", "excerpt": "I've been looking for an affordable, flexible, easy to learn robotics platform for years that I could use to teach kids the basics of programming/electronics/robotics.

However, questions remain about the viability of OSS for businesses and non-profits.

A pluggable type system can guarantee the absence of these errors, and many more real, important bugs.\r\n\r\nAre you a software architect who wants to be able to quickly and easily implement custom checks that prevent more errors at compile time? You need a framework that supports you in creating a formally correct code checker.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is aimed at both audiences. A pluggable type system can give a compile-time guarantee of important properties. We will explain what it is, how to use it, and even how to create your own. You can create a simple pluggable type-checker in 2 minutes, and you can enhance it thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe demo uses the Checker Framework, which enables you to create pluggable type systems for Java. It takes advantage of features planned by Oracle for Java 8, but your code remains backward-compatible. The pluggable type-checker can be run as part of javac or via an Eclipse plug-in, and integration with build tools such as Ant and Maven is provided. The tools are \"freely available\":http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/.\r\n\r\nThe Checker Framework provides 12 pluggable type systems that are ready to use, including nullness, immutability, and locking checkers. The presentation will first develop a simple declarative type checker that checks the consistency of method signature strings. The presentation will then discuss the design and usage of more advanced checkers.\r\n\r\nThe Checker Framework has found hundreds of bugs in over 3 million lines of open source code, including from Oracle, Google, Apache, etc. Overall, we found that the type checkers were easy to write, easy for novices to productively use, and effective in finding real bugs and verifying program properties, even for widely tested and used open source projects.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Jesse Hallett", "description": "The release of \"Firesheep\":http://codebutler.com/firesheep last year and \"the presentation by Reid Beels and Michael Schwern\":http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/484 at the last Open Source Bridge opened the industry's eyes to the fact that most web applications are inherently insecure.  Any application that sends requests over plain HTTP and that uses cookies to track user sessions is vulnerable to \"session hijacking\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Cookie_theft_and_session_hijacking.\r\n\r\nMany applications have reacted to this by offering options to run all traffic through HTTPS.  Examples include Gmail, Github, Facebook, and Twitter.  Using HTTPS does go a long way in improving web application security.  But in most cases HTTPS security is opt-in - probably due to difficulties in rolling out HTTPS on a large scale and added application complexity.  This means that only relatively paranoid users benefit.  Less fortunate users, like Ashton Kutcher, will often be \"left vulnerable\":http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/15/twitter-enables-always-use-https-setting/.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, HTTPS by itself does little to protect against \"cross-site request forgery\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery.  It is still necessary for developers to use \"form tokens\":http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2007/04/12/one-time-form-tokens/, \"JSON obfuscation\":http://directwebremoting.org/blog/joe/2007/04/04/how_to_protect_a_json_or_javascript_service.html, and the like to protect application resources.  This results in extra complexity and statefulness.\r\n\r\nCSRF(cross-site request forgery) does not just force complexity though.  Its existence actively stifles innovation.  The new \"cross-origin resource sharing specification\":http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/, which allows servers to opt-into cross-origin XHR(XMLHttpRequest) requests, presents many possibilities for rich interaction between web applications.  Unfortunately this specification is infrequently used because it opens up XHR(XMLHttpRequest) as another vector for CSRF(cross-site request forgery) attacks in cases where cookie authentication is used.  In the eyes of many developers this is just too dangerous to justify exploring a new technology.\r\n\r\nAll of these problems are products of the fundamental design of cookie authentication: what is essentially a temporary password is transmitted with every web request and that password is easily accessed - directly by eavesdroppers or indirectly by third-party web pages.\r\n\r\nThere are better options.  There are now pure JavaScript implementations of various cryptographic algorithms, including \"SHA-1\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1, \"SHA-256\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha-256, \"AES\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard, and \"RSA\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA.  There are also well-studied authentication mechanisms built on top of those algorithms designed specifically to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, like session hijacking.  And an authentication mechanism based on JavaScript rather than cookie data would be far less vulnerable to CSRF(cross-site request forgery).\r\n\r\nI will explore authentication mechanisms such as \"HMAC\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmac, as seen in \"OAuth\":http://oauth.net/, and block cipher authentication, e.g. \"CMAC\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMAC.  I will present on the applicability and feasibility of implementing these solutions in JavaScript in ordinary web applications.  I will analyze performance and cross-browser compatibility considerations.  Finally, I will demonstrate my own recommendation for next-generation browser authentication.", "title": "Cookies are Bad for You: Improving Security on the Web", "track": "Chemistry", "excerpt": "Almost every web application relies on cookies to authenticate each request after the user logs in.

This can be viewed as a regular Object-Oriented model, where objects (nodes), that have properties (labeled edges), whose values can be data types or other objects.  This makes an Object-Relational Mapping layer unnecessary, and any part of the data model can be presented in the REST paradigm at the URL it uses for its identifier.  With a plethora of graph stores available, this format is a flexible and effective choice for networked data with arbitrary link depth, and the graph query language allows for very powerful patterns to be queried.\r\n\r\nAlso covered: \r\n* Practical tips & tricks for incorporating open web schemas into your existing app, both consuming and publishing standard semantic web data.\r\n* Data inferencing: adding rules to infer additional information as logical entailments of your existing model data.\r\n* SPARQL, the standard graph query language (a description of a graph snippet with wildcards).\r\n* Turning your network graphs into exciting diagrams!", "title": "Getting Started with Semantic Web Applications", "track": "Cooking", "excerpt": "Leave rigid tables behind, and work with your data as a graph, using standard web data schemas.", "event": "2011", "id": 710, "audience_level": null}

Through our Phased Vulnerability Disclosure process, we provide increasing levels disclosure of vulnerabilities through a series of notifications, so industry can prepare without rushed actions, and critical infrastructure can be upgraded without \"bad guys\" knowing about the vulnerability. As an organization dedicated to open source software and open process, ISC is publishing the policies, processes, and tools involved in our process, and seeks to engage with the rest of the open source community to ensure that our process works smoothly for all of us, and to assist others who want to build similar processes for their own open source projects and organizations. This session will be part lecture on how ISC has done things, part a discussion of resources available for management of vulnerabilities, and part a brainstorming and planning session on how open source organizations can best collaborate to handle such issues effectively in the future.", "title": "Toward an Open Source Process for Security Vulnerabilities", "track": "Business", "excerpt": "Security vulnerabilities can be a source of anxiety and lost sleep, or they can be a carefully managed opportunity to bring communities together, practice safe operational practices, and prevent problems.

These sources are used for everything from localization to personalization and product querying.  As more services are added to provide this functionality, the number of network roundtrips increases along with bandwidth consumption, and due to interdependency problems and inconsistent APIs, product reliability suffers.\r\n\r\nThese were the main developer pains that lead to the development of ql.io, an open source querying system built on top of Node.js.  Using a SQL and JSON based language to declare API calls, interdependencies, forks and joins, filtering and projections, app developers are able to cut down the amount of effort required to integrate multiple APIs from hundreds of lines of code down to a few.  Besides the language itself, ql.io can be deployed as a stand-alone server, allowing you to deploy it as an HTTP gateway between client apps and API servers to have ql.io process and condense the data to just the fields that the client needs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will explore the underpinnings of ql.io and how Node.js powers this next generation system.

We know from research, however, that most people can\u2019t edit, and that building a visual editor is the most important thing we can do to bridge the gap. Previous attempts to use existing browser-based HTML editors to edit Wikitext have fallen short of the needs of Wikipedia, primarily because Wikitext is a superset of HTML and Wikipedia\u2019s content is so complex. We must create a new editor that is designed specifically for editing Wikitext.\r\n\r\nStarting in 2009, Wikimedia began conducting research on the usability of MediaWiki. We conducted several qualitative and quantitative studies and the research was analyzed and shared with the community. We discovered that users were sometimes able to make simple edits to simple articles, but that in most cases they would simply give up.\r\n\r\nWe spent over a year enhancing MediaWiki\u2019s wikitext editor. Much of our work was never able to be deployed because of the long tail of platform and browser issues which plagued our approach. Additionally, some of the early designs and assumptions were proven wrong in user testing, leading us closer to the conclusion that a visual editor is the only viable solution to significantly improving the usability of Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nFor over a year now we have been working on a visual editing system for Wikipedia. The editor is built entirely in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. We are also working on a new Wikitext parser which, unlike the previous system, can parse Wikitext into a document object model. This data model can then be edited, serialized back into Wikitext or rendered in various display formats. Looking to the future, we have also been building our systems to be capable of real-time collaborative editing.\r\n\r\nMaking Wikipedia easier to edit will make it possible for users previously unable to contribute to share their knowledge with the world. We believe that our approach could be enhanced to support many other markup languages, allowing the editor we are building to be reusable throughout the Internet.

His conclusions are comprehensive, but leave out implications for people like us who are responsible for the \"magic\" of technology as experienced by our users and customers.

This allows you to write an IRC client in around 30 or 40 lines of code. Basically you just use an IRC library to connect to a server, and publish the messages via redis. Then another pubsub channel is where your services give you replies that should go back into IRC. This means the \"Bot\" part of the code is totally decoupled from the services it's running.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part of this is that when you abstract the communication across processes, you also get abstraction across a network.

The Open University of Catalonia ran a Facebook-based course designed around this idea of peer learning. These activities, while successful as peer-learning, do not carry the hallmarks of functioning open source projects.\r\n\r\nA functioning open source project is exceptional in the way peer-mentorship works. People working on different aspects interact in sharing and mentorship capacities. One (temporary) example of successful peer-mentorship is from November, 2010, when the Debian mentor list has a 90% response rate to questions from newcomers aiming to join the project.\r\n\r\nIdeas of peer-mentorship, collaboration, interaction,and even mailing lists are generally foreign to the OER world. In cases where where they exist, they do not constitute communities engaged in improving the project they are discussing beyond translation work. \r\n\r\nBy talking about the nature of OERs in an opinionated environment of open source participants - with senses of community, community building, and peer-mentorship - I aim to refine these concerns and shed light on how open education can improve.\r\n", "title": "What Open Education Can Learn From Open Source", "track": "Culture", "excerpt": "While FLOSS projects aim to acquire contributors, Open Education projects look to acquire users.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Tim Chevalier", "description": "When writing systems-level applications like operating systems, device drivers, and Web browser engines, many things can go wrong. Null pointers, buffer overflows, and memory leaks all occur in C and C++-based applications in the wild, and can all cause serious security vulnerabilities. C and C++ compilers and tools are at best only partially able to detect these problems during development. While memory-safe languages such as Haskell and Scala solve these problems, historically, systems programmers have not found these languages acceptable for meeting their performance goals. Rust, a new open-source language being stewarded by Mozilla, aims to make memory safety bugs a thing of the past without sacrificing performance. Rust supports large-scale programming and its needs for reliability, efficient use of space and time, and concurrency.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial talk, I will show you how to write fast code in Rust with the help of a compiler that detects many potential bugs at compile time. I will start by showing you how to write simple prototypes in a subset of Rust that uses garbage collection. Then, I will refine these examples to use Rust's \"borrowed pointers\". Using borrowed pointers eliminates the overhead of garbage collection because the compiler can determine these pointers' lifetimes at compile time. I will show you how to manage memory in Rust in ways that are just as efficient as they would be in a C++ program but enjoy stronger compile-time correctness checking than C++ compilers provide. As I'll explain, this style of coding requires more thought during development because you have to be explicit about the relationships between data structures in memory, but it pays off in the long term by eliminating dangling pointers and memory leaks, without incurring unwanted memory management overhead.\r\n\r\nAll the examples I'll show will be based on real applications, potentially drawn from an audio decoder, an NES game emulator, and a prototype Web browser engine (Servo - https://github.com/mozilla/servo - under development at Mozilla). All examples will be adapted from open-source programs that are freely available on Github.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Sebastian Tiedtke", "description": "=Introduction=\r\n\r\nOpen source projects live off the fact that developers turn into contributors and invest their precious time into creating patches, bug fixes and or enhanced functionality for an Open Source code base.\r\n\r\nAs a maintainer of an Open Source project there's significant effort involved in correctly handling these contributions. Reviewing patches from contributors, ensuring the patches completeness (coding style issues and test coverage) are equally as important as running the patched code against the test suite before it\u2019s acceptance. Nobody wants to destabilize the usability of the code base or jeopardize the projects success or momentum, right?!\r\n\r\n=Let The Internet Work For You!=\r\n\r\nWe all love Github for their free code hosting and streamlined collaboration experience. Let's introduce two more players to the table to complete the stack:\r\n\r\nTravis, the Continuous Integration Service\r\nSauce Labs, Selenium Cloud Service\r\n\r\nGithub hosts a lot of the Open Source code which is crucial to the productivity of a Web Developer, however there is a lot more than hosting needed (test execution, static analysis, linting etc) to ensure the hosted code's quality. Travis CI is our friend. The guys at Travis provide a continuous integration service for the open source community free of charge to handle exactly this. In addition to the awesome integration with Github,  it'll check out the latest code and let us perform any given task we can think of, eg. kicking off a test runner for our unit tests or performing static analysis across the code base.\r\n\r\nTo keep up with outside contributions to one\u2019s open source project -- it\u2019s quite helpful to have a continuous build not just for the stable trunk of the project but also for contributing pull requests. Travis and Github came up with a nice solution to this problem -- they kick off builds in Travis-CI whenever a pull request was created and will make information about the build status available through the pull request management user interface.\r\n\r\nSauce Labs has a free service offering for Open Source developers, too. We\u2019ll be using their Selenium Cloud to run QUnit Javascript browser test suites against various browser and platform combinations.\r\n\r\n=Let\u2019s Connect The Dots=\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll be using a Github hosted example project to illustrate end-to-end integrated test execution. In order to make all these free services work together we\u2019ll need to write a thin layer of code to glue them all together. Enter node.js and grunt.js: Grunt.js is to node.js what GNU Make is to GCC. It\u2019ll let you perform repetitive tasks in an elegant way, using a set of common and or hand-crafted build tasks.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll show how we can leverage grunt.js tasks to make Travis-CI connect to Sauce Labs through an encrypted secure tunnel, launch a web server to serve the web pages that contain QUnit test suites and execute the javascript tests against a number of platform/browser combinations. Of course all the status information will be conveniently communicated across all the services.\r\n\r\nEver since javascript browser test execution has become such a common use case the sequence of steps required to accomplish aforementioned steps have already been implemented as a grunt.js task. I\u2019ll show how to leverage this for any Github hosted project. \r\n\r\n=How Does This Benefit Me As A Maintainer?=\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll show how Github, Travis-CI and Sauce Labs, can integrate build success / failure reporting into the collaboration workflow on Github to notify maintainers ahead of time about problems which may have gotten introduced with a code contribution.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this end-to-end test integration is that it will not only run whenever new code was committed, but also branches that have been submitted for merge to master through a pull request. No need for the project maintainer to check out code to their local machines and run tests repeatedly. By the time maintainers review pull requests they will already able to see whether the branch submitted for merge, met style and syntax, and if there were any problems running the javascript browser test suite.

The conversion of our user generated data from a mixture of unknown and unrecorded character sets to consistent UTF-8 added some interesting twists to our journey.\r\n\r\nWhile each application is different, Julie will give you the information you need to decide whether switching backends is right for your project and some tools to get you started. Although we switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL, most of the information applies to any SQL database. This talk will also be useful to people who have been thinking about switching backends for future projects or working on a project with an unfamiliar SQL dialect.\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, the application in question provide the CATME SMARTER Teamwork tools (http://www.catme.org) A demo is available at https://www.catme.org/login/survey_instructions", "title": "Switching Teams: Moving an Application from MySQL to PostgreSQL", "track": "Hacks", "excerpt": "The true life story of switching database backends in our application.", "event": "2013", "id": 988, "audience_level": "b"}

And they aren't even aware of the useful developments in other languages. And they may not be aware that a customization that works in their language is not available in other languages.

This is particularly challenging because MediaWiki's syntax, wikitext, is a superset of HTML and Wikipedia\u2019s content is so complex.\r\n\r\nIn the two years that we have been working on this project, we have encountered some unique challenges posed by creating an editor for wikitext and deploying it to an enormous corpus of existing articles have led us to push the limits of Web browsers, JavaScript, parsers and our own creativity.\r\n\r\nAt OS Bridge 2013, we will be a few days away from having VisualEditor be the default way people edit all Wikipedias in all languages. It has come a long way since the demonstration version we showed at OS Bridge 2012.

In this talk I want to take learnings from the philosophy of technology (for example, Albert Borgmann's framework of the Device Paradigm) and integrate them with software development specifically. Programming is, from the perspective of these learnings, highly ambiguous. On one hand, it is a preeminent example of a \"technology\", both in its essence and in the experiential process of coding (which changes from month to month as new supporting technologies emerge). On the other hand, software development is firmly on the \"create\" side of the \"create\"/\"consume\" divide.\r\n\r\nThese ambiguities make programming an enlightening case study for discussing philosophical issues in technology. Given that we are also personally invested in this discipline, the discussion can become more than philosophical, as we ponder the trajectory of programming based on what we have observed of the pattern of technology so far in its short history. Ultimately, I will argue that programming as we know it will change drastically in the near future, and that all non-essentially-creative aspects of it will be hidden behind layers of technological device.

Where we fall short, others will naturally come in and help fill the shortage. Community members are reasonably expected to help others who may be in need, and if they see something wrong or missing, they are supposed to be motivated to fill in the gaps.  On Wikipedia, this puts into practice one of its five pillars: that it is free content that <b>anyone can edit</b> (emphasis deliberate). fulfilling Wikimedia's mission of spreading knowledge and learning a little more about something every step of the way.\r\n\r\nThis is the wonder of open-source collaboration: we start something, then others jump in to help.  Whether we call it \"Wikimagic\", stygmergy, a collaborative ethos, etc., this is the promise that is sold to community members both new and old: the fact that this will somehow help build a better project because we can't reasonably expect everyone to know everything from the get-go.  That, perhaps, everybody can't do things right the first time, and we need to help them out because that's what's expected of us.

In addition, this interface needs to be able to communicate with a backend that provides dynamic data that is being presented to your user. For this you'll need Javascript.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to sidestep writing Javascript code directly, Opal and Coffeescript immediately come to mind.

Dictionaries, atlases, card catalogs, and encyclopedias featured prominently, as did the frameworks necessary to locate information within those resources. \r\n\r\nNow, as the analogue has given way to the digital, those indexing frameworks are being replaced by free* tools developed by corporations interested less in selling information to us and more in peddling us to advertisers. In a perfect \"Don't Be Evil\" world, this could work out to everyone's advantage.\r\n\r\nThings are rarely perfect, however. By turning over the indexing, organization, and delivery of information to entities who have financial incentives to keep their algorithms opaque to users, we have effectively moved to using a secret, invisible alphabet to organize the dictionary.

And most importantly, the animations happen without the slightest glitch. The JavaScript/C++ bundle efficiently handles all the back-end implementation, leaving the designers to concentrate on the animations and UI simplicity.\r\nSo, I was quite fascinated with the QML front end code when I was providing the themes in season of kde 2012 to kde-edu \"QML\" game pairs. I gradually started porting plasmoids like trashcan, window-list and the beautiful clock with calendar to QML in google summer of code 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plasmoids written in QML will have considerably less code as QML allows the creation of fluid UIs in a powerful declarative way. The QML code depending on QtQuick 1.x (present since Qt 4.7) is almost a straightforward porting since QtQuick 2.0 kept the source code compatibility with the previous version.Though porting C++codebase to Qt5 can be a bit complex since QTDeclarativemodule in Qt5 uses openGL and  scenegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe window-list uses tasks data engine to provide services so I added services like unclutter and cascade to it which was then made available to the QML code which acts as the front end.It gave a very smooth slide movements on scrolling up and down the list of windows.In digital clock, the plasmoids had to use the locale time and a calendar appears as a pop up .\r\nI then ported these plasmoids to plasma 2 which uses QML 2.0 and Qt 5.2 .\r\n\r\n\r\nPlasma Workspace is very well designed to accommodate various panels, widgets, etc. on the desktop and has seen many changes since KDE 4.1 in the plasma design and architecture. Its developer friendly code-base allows various programmers to easily create custom plasmoids which can be distributed as a small bundle and be easily integrated into the plasma workspace.\r\n\r\nI will explain about the impact of QML, how to get involved with it, how to port the plasmoids from Qt to QML codebase, providing a sample plasmoid to provide a demo, a brief introduction about the QML game pairs, how plasma is evolving, the vital use of data engines in QML plasmoids, its impact and the present scenario of Qt and QML in open source technology and the future implementations of QML .\r\n\r\nAnd, with the coming of QML, a better world is created in the open source technology.

I did this for years, and eventually it was time for a break!  For a while, I continued to work on projects, but ended up spending most of my time pursuing other interests, eventually returning to the work force in a non-technical role. By this time, the only reason I ever wrote any code was to maintain a couple of personal affinity-group websites.  I missed coding, or more to the point - I missed having a reason to code. Nevertheless, I had a full and enjoyable life. Then came the personal drama, the big C, stage IV. With great support and a positive attitude, I emerged from the process good-as-new, and with a renewed passion to live life to the fullest.

It's also, by necessity, taking the same fragmented approach as the vendor products; so, a library utilizing OSS, right now, might still not offer better UX than one that goes with vendors.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, there are two opportunities for open source to help save the day: 1) gradually replace more of the fragmented, expensive vendor products with well-built, scalable OSS; and 2) use the scalability and openness of OSS to get rid of the fragmentation and make everything more cleanly interoperable.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sheldon-hess.org/coral/files/osbridge.pdf\">Here's a PDF of the slides.</a>\r\n\r\nHere are the projects I linked to:\r\n<a href=\"http://vufind.org\">VuFind</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://swish-e.org\">Swish-E</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">Solr</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://nutch.apache.org/\">Nutch</a>", "title": "Open source software could save libraries!

{"status": "rejected", "speakers": "M. Edward (Ed) Borasky", "description": "Iannis Xenakis passed away on February 4, 2001. When he arrived in Heaven, he sought out his mentor, Olivier Messiaen. Messiaen said, \u201cIannis, there\u2019s someone here I want you to meet.\u201d The two walked over to a small sidewalk cafe, and there sat Harry Partch.\r\n\r\nAnd so from this fanciful meeting in Heaven, \u201cWhen Harry Met Iannis\u201d was born. From Partch, the piece inherits the 43-tone just scale, tuned to G = 392 Hz. Also from Partch, the piece inherits the need to build instruments to play in the Partch scale. The harmonies in \u201cWhen Harry Met Iannis\u201d are derived from the Tonality Diamond.\r\n\r\nNow we have the harmonic structure \u2013 the Tonality Diamond. This is where Xenakis comes in. Xenakis was a pioneer in stochastic music \u2013 music composed algorithmically by using chance elements. The Perl script that composed \u201cWhen Harry Met Iannis\u201d was given an initial state \u2013 a chord on the Tonality Diamond \u2013 and a duration for the piece. All the other elements of the score are derived stochastically by a random walk.\r\n\r\nThe duration for each note is chosen at random. Whether the note is sounded or silent is chosen at random. And the progression of chords around the Tonality Diamond is chosen at random. At each transition, one of four chord transformations is chosen at random:\r\n\r\n* The tonality can change from an Otonality to the corresponding Utonality or vice versa.\r\n* The chord structure can stay the same but be shifted up or down an octave.\r\n* A new Numerary Nexus can be chosen for the chord, with the rest of the structure remaining the same.\r\n* An Odentity or Udentity can be added or deleted, with the rest of the structure remaining the same.\r\n\r\nBecause some of these transitions can take the piece out of a practical performance range, if the piece goes out of range, the operation is reversed. For example, if the chosen transformation is to go up an octave and the resulting chord would be pitched too high, the next chord is instead chosen by going down one octave. If removing an Odentity or Udentity would leave an empty chord, one is added instead.\r\n\r\nOnce the score has been computed, the piece is rendered. For the 2001 and 2009 versions of the piece, I used a little-known digital synthesizer called sfront. Sfront is similar in principle to the much-better-known CSound digital synthesizer, but sfront code is vastly easier to read than CSound code.

Just three months later, WordPress shipped what is perhaps its most polarizing feature ever.\r\n\r\nGetting to this point required a series of technological advances years in the making, not to mention a belief we could actually pull it off. Users required constant reassurance that we could get it working reliably. A centralized API would be instructing self-hosted software to update itself on the fly. This would be run-of-the-mill web software, often running on shared hosting. And this would be tens of millions of sites \u2014 by some estimates, WordPress powers twenty percent of the web.

Would it be opt-in, or opt-out?\r\n\r\nWhile this is often ignored in open source, user interface preferences come at a clear cost. If there are too many, for example, users can\u2019t find any of them, and options are often used to avoid making a tough decision. Here, the cost was clear: letting users opt out of a security update would have had severe repercussions for the world wide web.\r\n\r\nWordPress 3.7 shipped with automatic updates on by default for security updates. And there was no checkbox to turn them off; you would need to go under the hood to do that. It was not just opt-out, but it was made difficult to do so.

It\u2019s an unnerving feeling that comes with managing and fulfilling projects in the real world where things are always messy and you never have complete control. For some, lack of experience and unknowns brings on the fear. For others, having been in the project trenches and seen it all creates fear with each new project. Either way, these fears tend to compound throughout the course of a project, creating a pressure cooker of stress as launch time nears.\r\n\r\nThis session will tackle project fear by fully defining it, investigating its roots, noting its symptoms, and ultimately discussing a number of successful coping mechanisms. We\u2019ll cover how to avoid falling into the traps of paralyzing inaction or frantic, reactionary plans. We\u2019ll take a look at the components of stress and how to find control in situations where you feel powerless.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Ele Mooney", "description": "Two years ago I spoke at Open Source Bridge in a short session called Citizens Online: Open Source Politics. This is a follow up to that talk; a deep dive into one of the most important components of software engineering for online communities. Identity Architecture considerations for civic engagement applications will be presented via a number of schemes. Impartial Identity Architecture is a theory of designing identity inspired by the gaming industry to minimize existing conflict models or maximize productive conflict. Push Tagging is a tagging model that allows a community to define their own vocabulary for efficient search and prioritization. Other schemes include peer to peer authentication, chaining, and physical artifacts to identify online users offline without compromising sensitive information. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 I was part of an online think tank trying to design standards for infrastructure for political action applications. Voter verification is a critical piece of this conversation since politicians don\u2019t actually care what people think, they care about VOTER opinion. Most of the suggestions involved enormously expensive, hard to secure, centralized databases which no one non-profit or non-government had the resources to build or maintain. Rejecting this approach, I started thinking about cheap, imperfect solutions that would be accessible to open source civic hackers as a way to get our foot in the door. This year, working with database developer Jeff Orr, we forked Passport, an authentication middleware for Node.js, and started working on one such scheme. Passport with Voter Verification is an open source project to verify voters with a Paypal account against the state voter registration database. While deeply flawed democratically (not every voter has a credit card!), it\u2019s still very pragmatic, doesn\u2019t permanently store any personal information, and could be useful in certain use cases. The constraints (response bias, etc.) are transparent, and you can produce analytics against the general voting population via percentages of response. Are solutions like this \u2018good enough\u2019 to have influence?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a long session, but the presentation will be an hour with the rest of the session open for your comments, questions, and applications.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Jen Griffin, Athena Yao", "description": "When \"Dreamwidth\":http://dreamwidth.org/ made its public debut in 2009, our code base was housed in a self-hosted Mercurial repository, and we used Bugzilla to track issues and feature requests.  In 2012, we switched over to using GitHub for our code repository, but continued to use Bugzilla instead of GitHub's issue tracker.  There were a few reasons we were reluctant to switch:\r\n\r\n* We needed to be open to drop-in contributors.  Most of our submissions come from Dreamwidth users who are making their first open source contributions.  GitHub is geared more toward full-time contributors who work on multiple projects.\r\n\r\n* Bugzilla provided greater flexibility.  It was relatively straightforward to customize our installation with the various fields, tags, and labels that worked best for our workflow and made searching for related items easier.\r\n\r\n* Some of our open issues needed to be kept private for security reasons, and only made visible to a small group of trusted developers.  Bugzilla made that as easy as selecting a checkbox.\r\n\r\nBut on one fateful day in early 2014, disaster struck: the virtual server that housed our Bugzilla database was deleted, with no backups.  Since we were being forced to start over from scratch with our issue tracker, and because our code was already on GitHub, it made sense to move the rest of our workflow onto GitHub as well.\r\n\r\nThe major problem we had out of the gate with GitHub's issue tracker was with permissions.  We wanted our users to be able to categorize and assign themselves to open issues without granting them commit access.  To solve this problem, we developed an automated monitoring system that would take actions based on the content of comments.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of our talk, we will cover the basics of the system we have developed. We believe it will provide a helpful example for other open source projects, especially any projects that might have started with only one or two active contributors and now have a larger team to manage.  We'll also talk about how we addressed the workflow issues that made us reluctant to quit using Bugzilla in the first place.", "title": "How We Learned To Stop Worrying And Love (Or At Least Live With) GitHub", "track": "Cooking", "excerpt": "In the past few years, GitHub has become the most widely used platform for managing open source projects, thanks to the ease it provides for submitting and accepting pull requests.

You can point out when a particular post exemplifies something great about the culture. You can point out particular rules that everyone needs to keep abiding by, without calling out a specific post.

Open source developers saw ourselves as tool producers; we would write code and post it on SourceForge with a helpful README. If someone found and liked the software, they would often begin a bottom-up approach to get that software adopted by their organization; they would try it on their own machine, and prove its usefulness to the rest of their team.\r\n\r\nThe mid-00\u2019s, with the advent of GMail, AJAX, commonplace software-as-a-service and the general explosion of rich web applications, changed how users expected to use software. Desktop applications like Rhythmbox found competition from web-based services like Spotify, and users began to desire and became used to the advantages web applications could provide. \r\n\r\nMany open source software developers, responding to the massive breadth of tools for building web applications, as well as the explosion of knowledge around building such applications, began to reach for the web as the interface and discovery mechanism for what they were building. In this part of the talk I\u2019ll hopefully be gathering quotes from creators of open source web application projects like NewsBlur, ThinkUp and Django.\r\n\r\nThis change resulted in benefits for the users and developers, but open source web apps face one key challenge: who is responsible for hosting? \r\n\r\nBottom-up adoption was enough to get Linux, Apache, PHP, and Samba a foothold in the enterprise.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Samantha Ritter, A. Jesse Jiryu Davis", "description": "We are two engineers who help build an open-source database called MongoDB and its language-specific drivers.  These drivers allow coders to use MongoDB in their programming languages of choice.  Some drivers are maintained by MongoDB Inc., some are maintained by the community, and some have mixed histories.\r\n\r\nMongoDB drivers are as idiosyncratic as the people who maintain them.  Historically we had no specs, so driver authors wrote ever more divergent code, with different features (and different bugs) making it difficult for users to transition from one language to another.  As a company, we couldn\u2019t define what we offered in a language-neutral way.  Our support team couldn\u2019t learn how to support drivers because they were too inconsistent.  Because there was no standardization and little communication, individual authors could not learn from each others\u2019 mistakes or successes.\r\n\r\nClearly we had a problem, one that persisted for years.  Why didn\u2019t we fix it sooner?  Reviewing implementations of a feature across all drivers was too difficult for any individual.  Spec authors faced driver authors\u2019 stubborn attachments to their specific designs.  Drivers written outside MongoDB Inc. were hard to regulate, and we struggled to balance an open-source anarchic spirit with company goals.\r\n\r\nWe had several false starts in solving this problem.  First, we wrote loose specs with no tests: authors ignored them and and we couldn\u2019t hold their implementations accountable.  Next we tried writing reference implementations, but again, there was no way to prove driver adherence.  Then we wrote tests in English, but they remained vague, unmaintainable, and unenforceable.  Cucumber, a testing tool from the Ruby world, was our best attempt, but it was loudly rejected by authors who didn\u2019t care for its aesthetics or couldn\u2019t support it in their languages.\r\n\r\nLast year we found something that works: we write specs in English and tests in YAML, a simple language that describes data.  Driver authors write harnesses for each suite of YAML tests, translating them into actions to perform in their drivers.  Some YAML tests are specific enough to act as unittests, some are broad enough to function as integration tests.  Each driver runs the same tests and proves it\u2019s up to spec.\r\n\r\nThis solution ends the eternal debate over spec compliance.  It encourages future specs, because now they work!  It overcomes barriers to communication between internal and external driver authors, and makes disputes over specs less personal.\r\n\r\nWe are beginning to standardize our drivers and to invite third party drivers to do the same.  With this system, we can validate third-party drivers and prove them to be as trustworthy as internally-developed ones, an open source ideal.", "title": "Cat-herd's Crook: Enforcing Standards in 10 Programming Languages", "track": "Cooking", "excerpt": "At MongoDB we write open source database drivers in ten programming languages.

The higher levels of a technical career cannot be reached unless you demonstrate effective mentorship. As Etsy\u2019s John Allspaw writes, senior engineers \u201clift the skills and expertise of those around them.\u201d You must demonstrate that you have this quality.\r\n\r\nBesides, junior engineers depend on your generous mentorship for their advancement. Your organization\u2019s future depends on you, too: you need more senior engineers and there aren\u2019t enough to go around. Bringing up young coders is a huge, risky investment, but it\u2019s the only way we have to make senior engineers. And finally, at many companies, including mine, there are very few female programmers, and men hold most of the senior engineering roles. Your best weapon to fight for a fairer future is mentoring female coders.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll present three case studies, from my experience mentoring interns and new hires at MongoDB, Inc. over the last two years. My first mentorship failed, the second went well, the third was an epic success. Why?\r\n\r\nFirst, we recap a disastrous mentorship and the warning signs I should have heeded: an absent visionary, unclear goals, an inexpert mentor (me), and the bad feeling that I ignored. We\u2019ll see the costly consequences of neglecting these bad omens.\r\n\r\nSecond, we examine a mentorship that went rather well and led to a turnaround in my career as a mentor. I learned to recognize positive signs that augured a successful mentorship, and I developed character traits that are useful for a mentor: I trained myself to be eager to help, to understand what my apprentice didn\u2019t know, and to admit when I didn\u2019t know something. I also learned how crucial the personal relationship is, as an aspect of the professional one.\r\n\r\nThird, we celebrate a great internship. I designed it for success, based on the lessons I\u2019d learned. I ensured there was a guiding visionary, expert mentors, and clear goals, and I cultivated a comfortable personal relationship with my interns. The interns made exceptional progress, culminating in their first speaking experience at a Python conference.\r\n\r\nFinally, I prove that your excuses for not being a good mentor are without merit. You can and should learn to train junior engineers well. Craftspeople have always trained the next generation by close relationships between masters and apprentices. If you are willing to develop your ability as a mentor, you can advance your own career, help your young colleagues and your company succeed, and lay the foundation for a fairer future.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "A. Jesse Jiryu Davis", "description": "Classical computer science focuses on CPU-bound problems. It is concerned with algorithms that complete computations quickly. But many networked programs spend their time not computing, but waiting for responses from remote machines. These I/O-bound programs present a very different challenge: wait for a huge number of network responses efficiently. The modern answer to this problem is asynchronous I/O, or \u201casync\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of async frameworks, programmers put their logic in callback functions that waited for network responses, made network requests, and then scheduled more callbacks to handle the next round of responses. Complex code descended into an unmanageable mess of spaghetti callbacks. Such code defeated traditional exception handling, and it was intimidating to debug.\r\n\r\nCoroutines are a newly popular programming style. They are memory-efficient in I/O-bound applications, but they possess all the grace and simplicity callbacks lack. Best of all, we can keep using time-tested techniques for handling exceptions.\r\n\r\nTo begin to understand how coroutines work, we look at an example of coroutine code in action. It is a Python generator, but what does that mean? We explore the Python interpreter\u2019s generator implementation, how it uses a stack frame and instruction pointer in an unorthodox way to pause and resume the generator at will.\r\n\r\nCoroutines build upon generators: they can pause waiting for a network operation, and resume when the operation completes. I show a minimal implementation of the Future and Task classes used in asyncio to schedule coroutines.\r\n\r\nCoroutines can be factored into subcoroutines, the same as regular functions can. We see how Python 3\u2019s \u201cyield from\u201d statement allows us to factor coroutines. Most comfortingly, exception-handling works with coroutines the same as with functions. We get a sane stack trace that shows where our program failed.", "title": "How Do Python Coroutines Work?", "track": "Chemistry", "excerpt": "Asynchronous I/O frameworks like Node, Twisted, Tornado, and Python 3.4\u2019s new \u201casyncio\u201d can efficiently scale past tens of thousands of concurrent connections.

Programmers increasingly use coroutines in place of callbacks to get the best of both worlds: efficiency plus a natural and robust coding style. I\u2019ll explain how asyncio\u2019s coroutines work. They are built using Python generators, the \u201cyield from\u201d statement, and the Future and Task classes.

{"status": "confirmed", "speakers": "Jamey Sharp", "description": "With this proliferation of Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) comes a growing number of stories of UAVs appearing in places they shouldn't (such as \"the White House lawn\":http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/white-house-drone-crash-government-employee-114642.html), or being commandeered in flight (such as \"in Iran in 2011\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident). On the other hand, the December 2013 announcement of \"Amazon Prime Air\":http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011 demonstrated that there is a huge potential market for safe commercial pilotless vehicles. What to do?\r\n\r\nMany of the safety and security challenges for UAVs are no different than for any software system: buffer overruns, missing or broken cryptography, and all the other bugs we've come to expect. In 2012, \"DARPA program manager Dr. Kathleen Fisher launched a program called HACMS\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D6jxBDy8k8 to explore new ways to address these systemic software flaws. One outcome of that program is the high-assurance quadcopter autopilot called \"SMACCMPilot\":http://smaccmpilot.org/, written primarily by my colleagues at Portland software firm \"Galois\":http://galois.com/.\r\n\r\nSMACCMPilot, a BSD-licensed project hosted publicly on GitHub, is a proof of concept demonstrating several techniques for writing high-assurance software. A key technology is our \"Ivory\":http://ivorylang.org/ embedded domain-specific language (also BSD-licensed), which acts as a verified safe subset of C. Because Ivory is embedded in Haskell, however, we're also able to use the full power of Haskell as a macro language to generate code that would be complex and error-prone to write by hand. We run the resulting software on an STM32F4 microcontroller, which is too small to even run Linux but more than enough for the C that Ivory generates.\r\n\r\nOther key technologies that Galois and our partners in the HACMS program have used include proper cryptography (obvious, yet missing from a surprising number of UAVs); formally-verified microkernels such as GPL-licensed \"seL4\":http://sel4.systems/; and theorem provers and SMT solvers to verify that run-time assertions can't actually fail under any inputs.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like deep magic, and some of it is&mdash;but we've found that these techniques are coming within reach of programmers outside academia. For example, non-Haskellers at Boeing have successfully used Ivory's C-like concrete syntax to implement level-of-interoperability for the Stanag 4586 standard for UAV communication, and many properties of interest in Ivory programs can be automatically proven using \"cvc4\":http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/, an open source SMT solver.\r\n\r\nThe end result: quadcopters running an earlier version of SMACCMPilot were called the most secure unmanned aerial system in the world after analysis by red-team penetration testers. 60 Minutes published a \"demonstration of SMACCMPilot\":http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/creating-drones-that-cant-be-hacked/ in February as part of \"their coverage of DARPA's I2O programs office\":http://www.cbsnews.com/news/car-hacked-on-60-minutes/, which includes the HACMS program.

People also want lots of user demand for their software, very international userbases, and lots of young people being involved. I'm going to explain some problems that can happen when you have a freedom-valuing software community with all of these things - they're great, but watch out.\r\n\r\nIn the iOS jailbreaking community, we have a popular and easy-to-use software distribution system (open source and built on APT/dpkg) with an integrated payment platform, and people can and do gain reputation and make money with it. The community includes huge user demand for new software, including many people willing to pay money for tools and services, even for open source tools (because it's easier to use the pre-compiled version). We have an extremely international userbase, where English-speaking and US-based users are the minority. A large percentage of the user and developer community is young, from about 13 to 19.\r\n\r\nThis environment means we also have serious problems with people grabbing code from GitHub, ignoring the license, and distributing and even selling it without complying with the license - which discourages people from releasing projects as open source. People use open source code to help them build adware and scams. People fork projects without contributing back to the original maintainer, or they build several similar projects without working together - it's tempting to gain reputation with your own project, it's possible to be successful without the effort of careful collaboration, and other related motivations get in the way as well. People get sad and discouraged when they release code with an open source license to contribute to human knowledge and then find out other people are selling it, even if that technically complies with the license. Blog spammers make ad-filled websites for projects in order to make a buck.\r\n\r\nI've worked on coping mechanisms for these systemic problems with limited success, including a list of projects that are open source (helping developers get reputation for this), an explanation for developers of the potential ramifications of putting an open source license on your project, and efforts at developer education about how to collaborate on open source projects.

XMPP and SIP tried to solve this, but haven't taken off as they might have done, leaving the internet dominated by closed proprietary islands of communication like WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.\r\n\r\nEnter Matrix: a set of pragmatic RESTful HTTP JSON APIs as an open standard, intended to be implemented on a wide range of servers, services and clients, letting developers build messaging and VoIP functionality on top of the Matrix ecosystem rather than adding yet another closed/proprietary solution.\r\n\r\nIn Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to a Matrix \"homeserver\" which stores all their personal chat history and user account information - much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP server.

It consists of an open standard defining RESTful HTTP APIs and open source, Apache-licensed reference implementations for creating and running your own real-time communication infrastructure.\r\n\r\nOur hope is to make VoIP/IM/IoT communication as universal and interoperable as email, and build an open ecosystem that people can use for a multitude of purposes.\r\n\r\nWe believe that real-time communication is fundamentally broken and fragmented on today's internet. XMPP and SIP tried to solve this, but haven't taken off as they might have done, leaving the internet dominated by closed proprietary islands of communication like WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.\r\n\r\nEnter Matrix: a set of pragmatic RESTful HTTP JSON APIs as an open standard, intended to be implemented on a wide range of servers, services and clients, letting developers build messaging and VoIP functionality on top of the Matrix ecosystem rather than adding yet another closed/proprietary solution.\r\n\r\nIn Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to a Matrix \"homeserver\" which stores all their personal chat history and user account information - much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP server.

When a user of a predictive text input system types the \u201ca\u201d key and \u201cp\u201d key to enter \u201capplication\u201d, the system suggests \u201capple\u201d, \u201capplication\u201d.

One such way predictive transliteration, where user could input a word, by intuitively combining the input alphabet phonetically and the predictive transliteration system should correctly convert it to the target language. \r\n\r\nFor both of these cases it is of paramount importance to learn about the users usage of the words and learn from the usage pattern/words to dynamically improve upon the prediction for better output candidates.

It\u2019s the web. We all know it. And we wouldn\u2019t be without it - it drives browser vendors to always be improving and therefore improving the Web. Well WebRTC isn\u2019t any different. Today we have a fractured offering from all the involved parties.\r\n\r\nThe trouble getting started with WebRTC is that it isn\u2019t even really comparable with getting started with CSS , JavaScript or HTML. Learning about the intricate needs of WebRTC is tough, and then add onto the top of that the fact that you have browser inconsistencies - you\u2019ve got a recipe for disaster. Most stories I hear are from people who give up trying to get something working, and the few that do make their initial communications work, then get stuck when they proclaim to their friends \u201cTry this thing I made, it\u2019s amazing!\u201d - only to hit audio and video issues.\r\n\r\nAlthough WebRTC is complex, it can be made easy once you understand the basics and learn about the available tools that you can use to make it a near walk in the park; from completely open source tools you can implement yourself to paid services that take care of almost everything for you.

I'm a longtime Wikipedia editor, and it's been a lot of fun to start writing on a community-oriented open-content (and open source) wiki with fewer restrictions, where I can make articles about less \"notable\" topics and go into more detail about local things I find interesting.\r\n\r\nOn LocalWiki, a community can write about the history of all the buildings in the neighborhood, document favorite lost businesses, explain the stories behind murals, make a list of the best places to see cats in shop windows...the more the better. You can write from your personal knowledge, not only based on formal published sources.\r\n\r\nI'll explain some background on LocalWiki itself, and I'll explain how I established a new LocalWiki region (for Isla Vista) - how I've done research for it, how I've encouraged other people to get involved, and how I've promoted it to local readers. (I've written a few updates about this aspect of the Isla Vista LocalWiki <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/islavistalocalwiki/\">in the discussion group for the project</a> if you're curious.)\r\n\r\nThen I'll show you how to edit LocalWiki, and we can all do some hands-on editing of the <a href=\"https://localwiki.org/pdx/\">Portland LocalWiki</a> or your favorite region.

Instead of starting from a math background, this presentation will take a network diagrams (the typical arrows and objects powerpoint illustration) and demonstrate it is actually a category. Changes to our category introduce us to functors, and functors lead us to natural transformations that let us merge multiple transformations while guaranteeing nothing breaks. Applied examples will take precedence, with the theory presented when appropriate and helpful to abstracting problems.\r\n\r\nUsing directed graphs to represent complex systems has can be an effective  approach without sufficient context to represent system constraints. Essential concepts from Category Theory such as categories and functors will be presented as concrete examples of systems.\r\n\r\nReal world applications spend inordinate amounts of time managing complexities introduced by schema changes.

A major retailer's data-driven marketing accidentally revealed to a teen's family that she was pregnant.

For instance, an activity tracker carelessly revealed users' sexual activity data to search engines. A social network's algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving families who'd recently experienced death of their child and other loved ones.\r\n\r\nWe design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. It's crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll delve into specific examples of uncritical programming, and painful results from using insightful data in ways that were benignly intended.

{"status": "proposed", "speakers": "Alec Reynolds", "description": "All web developers face a simple problem: to develop our projects locally, we need to install a set of services (a web server, a code interpreter, a database server) on our computers.\r\n\r\nWhile we've had methods to create this local development environment in the past, they all have unique issues. Local development solutions using native installations of basic services (think MAMP or installing services using Homebrew) don't achieve adequate production parity and leave team members using different versions of key tools. Newer virtualized solutions like Vagrant can solve some problems, but can be frustratingly slow to use.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a _local_ development environment seems particularly inadequate when many of our development tools are moving into the cloud. We host, test, even develop on remote platforms. Shouldn't our local computer integrate with production environments and remote services in the most seamless way possible?\r\n\r\nIn this BoF, I'll provide a short summary of existing local development services and lead a discussion around what qualities we, as open source developers, want to see in the ideal local development solution.
